# Changelog

## Live-only paper architecture cleanup

- Removed legacy paper deployment assets and paper profile entry points.
- Migrated production startup to always instantiate `LiveExecutionEngine` and log `execution_mode=live_only`.
- Introduced `ExecutionState` for live account, daily PnL baseline, fill de-duplication, ledger, status, dashboard, and Telegram reporting state.
- Retained `PaperExecutionEngine` only as an offline simulation utility for unit tests and historical analytics fixtures.
- Added live-only startup validation that rejects `PAPER_MODE=true`.

## Small-equity adaptive safety tuning

- Lowered missing-env defaults for small live equity: 3 grid levels, 10 USD order notional, 50 USD max position notional, 50 USD max active exposure, and 1800s stale order cleanup.
- Added ATR(14)/range-aware grid spacing with min floor, max cap, and structured logging for `spacing_source`, `atr_pct`, and `final_spacing_pct`.
- Added volatility-adjusted grid levels: low volatility 4 levels, normal 3, high 2, extreme 1 conservative level.
- Softened trend-biased grids to 70/30 by default, 80/20 only on strong confidence, and 60/40 on weak confidence.
- Added cleanup-aware `rebuild_reason` and one-cycle forced rebuilds after orphan/stale cleanup so recenter cooldowns do not leave the bot flat without a grid.
- Added a unified account/execution state source for strategy, risk, status, dashboard, and Telegram payloads, with `state_source=paper|live` logging.
- Kept daily PnL based on daily starting equity and persisted daily realized/fee baselines to avoid misleading percentage reports.
